        <h2>What is the purpose of DOMContentLoaded event listener?</h2>
        <p>DOMContentLoaded gets executed when the HTML document is loaded and it's parsing
            has taken place. It doesnt wait for other stuff like stylesheets, images to load either.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain how this collage is being generated</h2>
        <p><li> The array Imglinks holds all the links to the pictures.</li>>
            <li>The function addImageElements calls each element in the array Imglinks 
                and creates the tag img. These img ' s are then put in newImg
            </li>
            <li>newImg then gets added onto the list/gets appended and then displayed
                by calling the function addImageElements
            </li>
            <h2> Explain how the img elements are being positioned</h2>
            <p>The style (padding) of newImg is being changed and randomized using the math function
            </p>
            <h2> Look into the arrow function syntax ((d) => {}). What do you think of this syntax as compared to the other function syntax
                function(d){ }?</h2>
            <p> The arrow function is an alternative to the traditional way of function expression.
